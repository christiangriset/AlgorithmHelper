# Algorithm Helper

Welcome to the open-source content for [Algorithm Helper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.stanford.algorithms)! We'd like to become a valuable resource for anyone interested in algorithms, data structures, and computer science concepts. We'd love to have you contribute your knowledge; before doing so, please read this page.

The content here is hosted by Github [here](https://github.com/rpandey1234/AlgorithmHelper), accessible at: [http://rkpandey.com/AlgorithmHelper/](http://rkpandey.com/AlgorithmHelper/)

## Instructions

Above all else, our writing style is understandable. We want readers to get the core concepts of the topic as they read it on the go, on their phone. Our guides are less about facts and more intuition. We prefer language-agnostic concepts rather than going into gritty implementation details. Writing a guide is a great way to understand something even better =)

The content in this project is meant to be easily modifiable. All content is written in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Feel free to modify pages inline. 

TODO: how to adding a new page.
